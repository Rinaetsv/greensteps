        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>GreenSteps began in 2020 when a small group of university students in Johannesburg came together to clean up a local park that had been neglected for years. What started as a one-day initiative quickly gained support from the community and sparked a movement. With a shared passion for nature and sustainability, the group officially registered as a non-profit organization and began organizing regular environmental events, partnering with schools, and creating educational content for the public.</p>
        <p>Today, GreenSteps operates across several provinces in South Africa, reaching hundreds of volunteers and thousands of learners every year. Our journey proves that small actions, when consistent and collective, can lead to big change.</p>

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to empower individuals, especially youth, to take action in preserving the environment. Through educational programs, hands-on community activities, and collaboration with local leaders, we aim to foster environmental responsibility and inspire a culture of sustainability.</p>

        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>We envision a world where people live in harmony with nature — where environmental awareness is a core part of every community’s values, and every individual takes responsibility for protecting our planet. Our goal is to create long-term environmental impact through education, action, and innovation.</p>
